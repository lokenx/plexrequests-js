# plexrequests-js
One page version of Plex Requests that only sends PushBullet notifications to an API key.

Simply edit line 120 with your own PushBullet API key and you're done! When people request movies you'll get a notification with the name and year of the movie and that's it.

For a more automated process that will cross-check Plex content you already have amongst other things check out my other repo [https://github.com/lokenx/plexrequests](plexrequests).

Sample can be seen [http://lokenx.github.io/plexrequests-js/](here!)
