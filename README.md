# plexrequests-js
One page version of Plex Requests that only sends PushBullet notifications to an API key.

Simply edit line 120 with your own PushBullet API key and you're done! When people request movies you'll get a notification with the name and year of the movie and that's it. It does have the key hard coded and can be seen by viewing the source so please keep that in mind. If anyone knows of a better way to do this all client side let me know!

For a more automated process that will cross-check Plex content you already have amongst other things check out my other repo [plexrequests](https://github.com/lokenx/plexrequests).

Sample can be seen [here](http://lokenx.github.io/plexrequests-js/)!
